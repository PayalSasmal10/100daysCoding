# 100daysCodingChallenge Repo for self learning

Today I was excited to learn about more connect databases, By doing that I have learnt about try & except blocks. I have created a login GUI to login into #mysql  database using #Tkinter. There instead of using pack, I used place. I got to know the differences between them.



This is a good article to know more about place and pack.
